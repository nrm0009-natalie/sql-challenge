# SQL Analysis Project

The purpose of this project was to extract, process, and analyze corporate employee data contained in multiple CSV datasets. These tasks were completed using SQL queries (through PostgreSQL) which stored and inspected the data, and therefore relevantly related the sets of employee data to one another.

### Technologies

* PostGres, MySql

## Methods Used

### Data Modeling

1. Inspect employee data CSV datasets.
2. Determine parameters for primary and foreign keys.
3. Create table schema in online entity relationship diagram (ERD) software (http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/).
4. Connect tables with foreign keys to tables with matching primary keys.

### Data Engineering

1. Create PostgreSQL database for employee data.
2. Create table schema in database.
3. Import employee data CSV datasets into appropriate tables.


### Data Analysis
#### Perform appropriate queries, within and across tables, to obtain the desired data.

1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.

2. List employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.

4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
